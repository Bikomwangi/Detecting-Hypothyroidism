   # Detecting-Hypothyroidism

This model determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.


   **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Hypothyroidism is one of the most common diseases worldwide, and levothyroxine is the usual medication prescribed to manage it. Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland, located in the neck, does not produce enough thyroid hormone for the body’s requirements. This can result in heart disease, infertility, and poor brain development in children. People with hypothyroidism may have changes in body weight, and feel tired, weak or unhappy, all of which can reduce their quality of life. This project aim at utilizing machine learning to predict whether or not a patient has a hypothyroid condition based on their symptoms. The model was trained on data collected from a health camp that was facilitated by Nairobi Hospital. Patient's records in the data include age, sex and a classification of a whether or not the patient has hypothroidsm and others.


   **SOFTWARES USED**

This project uses python libraries to conduct data anlysis and utilize Decsion Trees classifiers and Support Vector Machine to create the prediction model
